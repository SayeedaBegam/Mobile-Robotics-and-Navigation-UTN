Task Overview
In this task, you are implementing functions to load and summarize a dataset that contains x and y coordinates along with labels. The objective is to analyze the dataset to understand its structure and properties.

Step-by-Step Explanation
Step 1: Loading the Dataset
Function to Implement: load_data()
File: data_loading.py
Purpose: This function should read a CSV file and return the dataset as a pandas DataFrame.
What You Would Do:

Read the CSV File: Use pandas.read_csv() to load the dataset from a specified file path.
Return the DataFrame: The function should return the DataFrame so that it can be used later for analysis.
python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

def load_data(filename):
    data = pd.read_csv(filename)
    return data
Step 2: Analyzing the Dataset
Function to Implement: compute_summary(data)
File: data_loading.py
Purpose: This function computes summary statistics for the dataset, grouped by the labels (-1 and 1).
Understanding the Code:

Check Data Type: The function first checks if the input data is a NumPy array. If it is, it converts it to a pandas DataFrame.

python
Copy code
if isinstance(data, np.ndarray):
    data = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=['label', 'x', 'y'])
Check for Empty Data: It checks if the DataFrame is empty or not loaded correctly. If it is, a message is printed, and None is returned.

python
Copy code
if data is None or data.empty:
    print("The dataset is empty or not loaded.")
    return None
Grouping the Data: The data is grouped by the 'label' column using data.groupby('label'). This allows you to compute statistics separately for each label.

python
Copy code
grouped = data.groupby('label')
Calculating Counts: The counts of entries for each label are calculated using grouped.size().

python
Copy code
counts = grouped.size()
Calculating Averages: The average values of x and y for each label are computed using grouped[['x', 'y']].mean().

python
Copy code
averages = grouped[['x', 'y']].mean()
Calculating Standard Deviations: Similarly, the standard deviations of x and y for each label are calculated using grouped[['x', 'y']].std().

python
Copy code
std_devs = grouped[['x', 'y']].std()
Creating a Summary Dictionary: Finally, a dictionary is created with keys cnt, avg, and std, containing the counts, averages, and standard deviations, respectively.

python
Copy code
summary = {
    'cnt': counts,
    'avg': averages,
    'std': std_devs
}
Return the Summary: The summary dictionary is returned to the caller.

python
Copy code
def compute_summary(data):
    # ... (check data, group, and calculate statistics)
    return summary
Example Usage
At the end of your code, you have an example usage of the compute_summary function:

Create a NumPy Array: This array simulates a small dataset with labels and coordinates.
Compute Summary: The compute_summary function is called with this array, and the returned summary is displayed.
python
Copy code
data_array = np.array([[1, -0.5, 0.3],
                       [-1, -0.7, -0.1],
                       [1, 0.5, 0.8]])
summary = compute_summary(data_array)
Logic Behind the Implementation
Data Handling: The function can accept both pandas DataFrames and NumPy arrays, making it flexible.
Statistical Summary: By grouping the data by labels, you can quickly compute important statistics that can help in understanding the distribution of data points belonging to each class.
Error Handling: Checking if the data is loaded correctly helps prevent errors during execution.

Let's walk through the code step by step and discuss how it visualizes the dataset, helping us better understand where the data point 
(
‚àí
1.4
,
1.5
)
(‚àí1.4,1.5) might belong.

Step-by-Step Explanation
Step 1: Create Sample Data
Here, we define a small dataset using a NumPy array. Each row consists of a label (either -1 or 1) followed by its corresponding 
ùë•
x and 
ùë¶
y coordinates.

python
Copy code
data_array = np.array([[1, -0.5, 0.3],
                       [-1, -0.7, -0.1],
                       [1, 0.5, 0.8],
                       [-1, -1.4, 1.5]])
Step 2: Create a DataFrame
Next, we convert the NumPy array into a pandas DataFrame, which makes it easier to manipulate and visualize.

python
Copy code
data = pd.DataFrame(data_array, columns=['label', 'x', 'y'])
Step 3: Define the compute_summary Function
This function calculates summary statistics for the dataset, grouped by labels. It computes:

Counts of each label
Mean values of 
ùë•
x and 
ùë¶
y
Standard deviations of 
ùë•
x and 
ùë¶
y
The results are organized into a dictionary and returned.

python
Copy code
def compute_summary(data):
    # Ensure the data is not None or empty
    if data is None or data.empty:
        print("The dataset is empty or not loaded.")
        return None
    
    # Group by label
    grouped = data.groupby('label')
    
    # Calculate counts, averages, and standard deviations
    counts = grouped.size()
    averages = grouped[['x', 'y']].mean()
    std_devs = grouped[['x', 'y']].std()
    
    # Create summary dictionary
    summary = {
        'cnt': counts,
        'avg': averages,
        'std': std_devs
    }
    
    return summary
Step 4: Compute Summary Statistics
We call the compute_summary function to analyze the dataset and print the summary statistics.

python
Copy code
summary = compute_summary(data)
if summary is not None:
    print("Counts:")
    print(summary["cnt"])
    print("\nAverages:")
    print(summary["avg"])
    print("\nStandard deviation:")
    print(summary["std"])
Step 5: Visualization
Here‚Äôs where the visualization takes place:

Color Coding: We define a lambda function that assigns colors based on the label: blue for -1 and orange for 1.

python
Copy code
color = lambda label: "tab:blue" if label == -1 else "tab:orange"
Scatter Plot: We create a scatter plot of the existing data points, coloring them according to their labels.

python
Copy code
plt.scatter(data['x'], data['y'],
            color=np.vectorize(color)(data['label']),
            label='Data Points'
)
Highlighting the New Data Point: The new data point 
(
‚àí
1.4
,
1.5
)
(‚àí1.4,1.5) is added to the plot with a red "X" marker.

python
Copy code
plt.scatter(-1.4, 1.5, color='red', marker='x', s=100, label='New Data Point (-1.4, 1.5)')
Plot Customization: Labels, title, grid lines, and legends are added for better readability.

python
Copy code
plt.xlabel('X-axis')
plt.ylabel('Y-axis')
plt.title('Data Visualization')
plt.axhline(0, color='black', lw=0.5, ls='--')  # Horizontal line
plt.axvline(0, color='black', lw=0.5, ls='--')  # Vertical line
plt.legend()
plt.grid()
Show the Plot: Finally, the plot is displayed to visualize the dataset.

python
Copy code
plt.show()
Interpretation of the Visualization
The scatter plot visually separates the data points belonging to classes -1 and 1.
The new point 
(
‚àí
1.4
,
1.5
)
(‚àí1.4,1.5) is situated in a region where both classes appear to overlap, making it difficult to classify with certainty.
The proximity of this point to existing points from both classes suggests that its classification could vary depending on the decision boundary established by the perceptron.
